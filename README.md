# First Codecademy Project - Random Message Generator #
### January 28, 2021 ###

I will be using javascript to create a random message generator. I've 
decided on using an ad lib model where I will use arrays of message templates, nouns, and verbs. 

To test the project, run the program and you should receive a random 
message.

Thanks for stopping by.
